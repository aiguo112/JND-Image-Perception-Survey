The Just Noticeable Difference Survey App is a Python GUI application designed to conduct surveys related to the Just Noticeable Difference (JND) between two images. This app provides a platform for users to view pairs of images and determine if there is a noticeable difference between them, contributing to research in visual perception and human cognition.

# Features
Image Comparison: Participants are presented with pairs of images and asked to determine if there is a noticeable difference between them.

Randomization: The order of image pairs is randomized to minimize bias.

Data Collection: Responses are collected and stored for analysis, helping to understand perceptual thresholds.

Visualizations: Visualize the collected data using graphs and charts to gain insights into perceptual sensitivity.

# Getting Started
Follow these instructions to set up and use the Just Noticeable Difference Survey App on your local machine.

# Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Tkinter (usually included in standard Python distributions)
Pillow (PIL Fork for working with images)
CustomTkinter (installable via pip)

# Installation
1- Clone the repository to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/jnd-survey-app.git

```
2- Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd jnd-survey-app
```

3- Install the required dependencies:
```
pip install Pillow
pip install customtkinter
```
4-Run the App
```
python main.py

```

# Contributing
Contributions are encouraged! If you'd like to contribute to the Just Noticeable Difference Survey App, please refer to the contribution steps outlined in the main README.

# Acknowledgments
This app was created to support research on Just Noticeable Differences in visual perception.
Special thanks to the developers of Tkinter, Pillow, and CustomTkinter for their valuable libraries.
